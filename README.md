# SPLINE: Simple Programming Language for Imperative Numeric Expressions

**SPLINE** is a static analyzer for the Simple Programming Language of Imperative Numeric Expressions.
It includes a reference implementation of the language, built directly from the specification in [Tutorial on Static Inference of Numeric Invariants by Abstract Interpretation](https://mine.perso.lip6.fr/publi/article-mine-FTiPL17.pdf).
On top of this foundation, SPLINE provides a set of analysis techniques to infer numeric invariants of programs.
